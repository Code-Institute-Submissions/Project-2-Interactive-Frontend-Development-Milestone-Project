Project 2 interactive-frontend-dev-project

The goal of the project was to design a interactive frontend only website. The website is designed for people planning a holiday to allow them to search for different activities they can partake in while on holiday.  

*-UX-*

The process for designing this website began my searching [1] and [2] for design ideas along with travel websites. The websites used for design ideas included [3] and [4]. The basic design for the navbar was taken from [5]. The google maps platform has various guides and support [6] thats useful when designing map functionality.

*-page by page walkthrough of website features-*
This project consists of one webpage.
The page consists of a navbar with internal links for each continent and the contact form.
The map part of the page allowing the user to search difference cities, towns and postcodes within various countries to obtains infomation on various places including hotels,art galleries museums bars restaurants and cafes. Clicking on each marker provides information about each location including the address, Telephone number, aggregate review and website of the location.   Below the map is the list of the various places listed on the map corrisponding alphabetically to the markers on the map.
Below that are the travel locations that are searchable within each continent and the contact form below that.

Potential future features.
1. A website forum allowing people to discuss there holiday experieces with other customers.
2. Sign in / profile page
3. Email subscribe list
4. Google maps APi is limited in a few ways making it impossible to show on multiple place types at one time.
